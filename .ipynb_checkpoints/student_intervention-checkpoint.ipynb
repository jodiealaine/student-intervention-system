    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",

    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
